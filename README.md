# zt

zt is a software for testing correlation in distance matrices, using a permutation test. Simple correlation can be analysed for two distance matrices, and with three matrices partial correlation can be tested. This procedure is known as the Mantel test. For instance, genetic and geographical distances can be tested in group of species.

zt is a command line tool. The source files can be compiled easily, but pre-compiled binaries are available. See the readme.txt file for more instructions on how to compile, test and use the software.
